<H5> Introduction </H5>
<P>My name is Emma Faulk. I am currently a senior at the University of Georgia, and plan
to graduate in May 2018. I have attened UGA for the entirety of my college career. My major is political
science with a minor in Communication Studies. I am fascinated with current events and enjoy
studying about them through a historical political context. At this university, I have discovered
my passion for the community along with my eagerness to learn about the history of the United States.</P>
<H5>Academic Interests</H5>
<P> The best classes that I have taken at UGA have been Southern Politics and Great American Speeches
and Speakers. These two classes have led me to know more about where I live in the South, and
how our country has been influenced by communication over the course of its existence. In Southern
Politics, we learned about the history of the southern United States, and how it has been shaped
by Civil War Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement. The Great American Speeches and Speakers
class allowed an inside look in the lives of people throughout history by examining famous speeches
from American History. These two classes narrated an untold history of the United States, in a way
that many textbooks can't detail. Each of them brought a new understanding of our country that I
had not been introduced to before college.</P>

<P> While at UGA the past 4 years, I have been fortunate enough to be apart of wonderful
organizations here on campus. My freshman year, I was a member of SGA's Freshman Focus,a group that
acclimates freshman toward SGA involvement and allows them to actively participate in Senate committee
meetings. Additionally, I participated in <A href = "SWAB.html">Shop with a Bulldawg </A> as a mentor and was a special events
committee member for Relay for Life. During my sophomore year, I continued my involvement with Shop
with a Bulldawg as a committee member. Here I helped raise money for the organization to promote
the main event day, where local underpriviledged children are given the opportunity to shop for
holiday gifts. This membership continued into my junior year. Throughout college, I have been
involved in the Wesley Foundation, a campus minstry at UGA. I have served as a student discipler
in their leadership program. </P>
